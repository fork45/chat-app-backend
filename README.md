# General
This is the backend for my personal project called QWEERT, I can't say that all code is fast and can work without errors, if you find a bug then open a new issue (and open a pull request if you know how to solve this bug), I'm happy for every contribution you make to this project

Right now I'm making a frontend for the project and when I'm done I'll put it on Github too

If you want news about this project follow my [telegram channel](https://t.me/qweertapp) (don't worry I will not piss you off with frequent notifications)
