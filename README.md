# Archived
This is an older version of the backend of my application called Axios, at the time this code was developed, the project was called QWEERT.
I rewritted the entire backend to nestjs, [here is a link to the relevant server code](https://github.com/fork45/axios-chat-server)

# General
This is the backend for my personal project called QWEERT, I can't say that all code is fast and can work without errors, if you find a bug then open a new issue (and open a pull request if you know how to solve this bug), I'm happy for every contribution you make to this project

Right now I'm making a frontend for the project and when I'm done I'll put it on Github too
